## General info
The repositrory contains code snippets of small problem which highlights interesting techinques in general.
There may exist some errors, or maybe there exist some better implementation.
Anyway, feel free to leave me a message if there are any problems.

### Fibonacci numbers
Note: The parallel algorithm I used is based on divide and conquer.

I tried many other methods, however the results are not always consistent.
There are many better ways of doing this.

### Simple histogram

### Print Binary numbers
This is an interesting implementation of printing binary nuumbers
accoridng to the IEEE standard.

Note: The code itself may not be complete, since I am still checking.

### Calculating PI by MPI
This is just a very naive implementation of MPI fundamentals
